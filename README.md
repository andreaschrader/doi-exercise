This is a repository to train making a GitHub repository (project, data, code) public using a sandbox and following [instruction](https://coderefinery.github.io/github-without-command-line/doi/) which are part of this repository by coderefinery: https://coderefinery.github.io/github-without-command-line/doi/ (CC-BY 4.0).
The process is documented along these instructions and additional explanations are added along the way.

## Step 1 - Create an example repository

### Create the repository with a README
In the first step this public repository was created with a description and this [`README.md file`](./README.md).

### .gitignore
I added a [`.gitignore`](./\.gitignore) file to avoid pushing files into this public repository which are not relevant for its content. For this, I selected the Visual Studio `.gitignore` version.  

I also add the `.DS_Store` file to the repository's `.gitignore` file for macOS.  

### LICENSE
Moreover, I added a [LICENSE](./LICENSE) and referenced the instructions I used for this exercise - in particular including the repository in which these instructons reside.  
This was done, because the coderefinery repository has a CC-BY 4.0 license and, at least for this repository, I did not find another citation. 
Therefore, I want to ensure proper referencing and enable others to reuse content of this repository by knowing about the license.
