    This repository documents the training to publish a GitHub repository with a persistent identifier (doi) using the Zenodo sandbox in order to prepare for future Zenodo submissions and making selected GitHub repositories citable. 
    Beyond this, also two files for citation relevant metadata, CITATION.cff and .zenodo.json 
    are explored with respect to the Zenodo submission process, experienced obstacles were documented
    and working examples are created. /n

This work serves not only for own training but also to provide a respective documentation to ease such processes in the future.
