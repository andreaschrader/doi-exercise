    "description": "This repository documents the training following the Coderefinery contributors' 'github-without-command-line' doi-exercise to publish a GitHub repository with a persistent identifier (doi) using the Zenodo sandbox in order to prepare for future Zenodo submissions and making selected GitHub repositories citable. Beyond this, also two files for citation (and other) relevant metadata are explored with respect to the Zenodo submission process (CITATION.cff and .zenodo.json). Experienced obstacles were documented and working examples were created for this repository. Role: 'Academic Expert in Data Science for CEPLAS at University of Cologne'. 'CEPLAS, Cluster of Excellence on Plant Sciences, is funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany's Excellence Strategy, EXC-2048/1'"
